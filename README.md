KNOWN BUGS
Fix this package the next time it is important to scrape GSM data.
Andrew Feb 2013

Download posted GSM data from GEO

Requires [geo_api](https://github.com/andrewdyates/geo_api) in Python path.

WARNING: The loose scripts in this package have some bugs. For example: each sample may be placed on its own line rather than placing all samples on the same line.
The supported "script.py" downloader is memory inefficient and may run out of memory.
Merging GSM into an expression matrix typically requires some kind of custom output formatting.
